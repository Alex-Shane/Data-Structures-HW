## Unit testing TreapMap

The biggest challenge in testing treap is the randomness of the priorities. To get around this, I created a non-default
constructor and put in a seed (I used 5 as my seed). I then determined what the first 10 numbers of the sequence of numbers
generated by this seed was and wrote them down before my tests in the treap test file. Since these numbers were random,
I had to get creative with ways in which to add nodes so that the correct rotations would occur after insert or removal,
or to make sure no rotation happened at all.

Example 1: For testInsertCausingNoRotations(), I had to make sure that my root node was the median string value since
the first number in my seed sequence was a large negative number and the next two were positive numbers. By choosing the root
to be the median value, the min priority was already the root, so the 2 children with larger priorities were added with 
no rotations needed. So the final tree was simply root 5 with children 4 and 6. 

Example 2: testInsertCausingRightRotation() was a bit tricky in thinking about how the final tree would look because with 
the results of my seed it is not the same as if I performed the same sequence of operations with AVL tree. Whereas 
adding 3 then 2 then 1 to an AVL tree would result in a right rotation on 3 to result in a tree with root 2 and children
1 and 3, Treap fixes the priority issue with 2 rather than the height issue with 3, so the right rotation occurs on the node
with key 2, and thus the height of the tree after insertion is 2 whereas with AVL it was only 1. 

Example 3: testRemoveCausesMultipleRotations() was a bit challenging in thinking about how to set up since in an AVL
tree, deleting 3 as the root from a tree that was root 3, children 2 and 4, resulted in no rotations and just a tree 
with 2 as the root and 4 as the only child. However, due to the priorities from my seed, 4 needed to be the root as it had
the smaller priority and thus the test resulted in both a left rotation and right rotation on 3 before it could be removed
as a leaf.
